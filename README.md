NextWindow Fermi Kernel Module


This is originally from [here](https://launchpad.net/nwfermi/), but that hasn't been updated in a while. This branch just fixes some compile errors and adds some device IDs. 
It doesn't resolve all of the outstanding bugs in that project; unfortunately, most of the real logic is inside the closed-source daemon. 

For some instructions about getting this running, see [http://tangopardo.com.ar/2cf7/2013/07/27/installing-a-nextwindow-fermi-touchscreen-under-ubuntu-13-04-raring].
That blog post is about getting it running on Ubuntu 13.04 Raring, but I did basically the same thing with Fedora 19.
